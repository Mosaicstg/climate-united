# General information

This project is built using the following stack:

- [Remix](https://remix.run/): a fullstack React framework that focus on using web standards that is designed to render code on the server, then hydrate on the client for interactivity
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/): a headless content management system you can query using their API in various tech stack applications
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/): a TypeScript-first validation library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): a utitlity-first CSS framework that works really well with most JS-tech stacks and ensures every page (or route) has the least amount of CSS needed
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): an opinionated code formatter and pretty much the industry standard (as of this doc writing) for IDE/Code Editor formatting
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): a code static analyzer to assist in finding bug/problems
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): a CLI tool that easily intalls copy-and-pasteable accesssible UI components without the need of excessive dependencies
